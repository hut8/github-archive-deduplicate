# github-archive-deduplicate
Get rid of duplicates that made their way into the GitHub Archive

I mostly just uploaded this so I'd have it and so that others can check my work so that GitHub events aren't lost forever.

events-per-file :: script to generate map of event ids to the files they are in
deduplicate-file :: filter to remove duplicate event ids (use pipes)
